                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Toyota, founded by Kiichiro Toyoda in 1937, originally emerged from the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, specializing in automotive production. The company quickly became a global leader in manufacturing and innovation. Early models like the 1936 Model AA sedan marked Toyota's entry into the automotive world, followed by major milestones like the development of mass-market vehicles post-WWII. In the 1980s and 1990s, Toyota became renowned for its reliability, with models like the Corolla and Camry becoming global bestsellers. Innovations such as the introduction of the Prius in 1997, the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle, highlighted Toyota's leadership in eco-friendly technologies. Toyota's expansion in motorsport also gained prominence with the establishment of Toyota Gazoo Racing in the 2000s. This division is involved in several racing events worldwide, including the World Rally Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where Toyota has earned multiple victories in recent years. The company continues to evolve with the release of its GR-branded vehicles like the GR Supra, GR Yaris, and GR86, emphasizing high-performance models alongside its extensive lineup of reliable, everyday cars.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Tesla's founding story is intertwined with its ambitious drive to create electric vehicles that could outdo traditional gasoline-powered cars. It all began in 2003, when engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, initially driven by their background in technology and entrepreneurship, founded the company. They were inspired by the potential of lithium-ion batteries and believed electric vehicles could disrupt the automotive industry. The company's first car, the Roadster, was an ambitious project built around the Lotus Elise body but powered by Tesla's own battery technology, which allowed it to be the first fully electric sports car with significant range and performance. However, the early years were far from easy. Elon Musk, who joined Tesla after leading its initial funding round, was involved with the company from the start, though he wasn't one of its original founders. He later took on a more visible role as CEO, which led to some controversy. Eberhard, who was ousted from the CEO position in 2008 amidst internal tensions, filed a lawsuit against Musk, claiming Musk had pushed him out while publicly disparaging him and impacting Tesla's financial health. The lawsuit was settled in 2009. Despite the early struggles, Tesla, under Musk's leadership, grew rapidly, thanks to strategic shifts such as the development of the more affordable Model S and the company's expansion into energy solutions. Today, Tesla remains one of the most influential companies in the EV market, with a legacy of transforming not only the automotive industry but also shaping the future of sustainable energy.</p>
